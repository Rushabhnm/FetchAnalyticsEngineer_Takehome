# Fetch Take Home Test - Analytics Engineer

## Overview

This repository contains the completed Fetch Rewards Data Engineering assessment. The exercise involved structuring unstructured JSON data into a relational model, writing SQL queries to answer business questions, identifying data quality issues, and effectively communicating findings to stakeholders.

## Data Modeling

I have normalized the three unstructured JSON files (Receipts, Users, and Brands) and cleansed the data. The rewardsReceiptItemList column in the Receipts dataset contained a list of dictionaries describing purchased items, which I further normalized into a separate table. As a result, I have structured the data using a Snowflake Schema, ensuring efficiency and ease of querying.

The relational diagram depicting the structured data model has been included in this repository.
